# Reddit-Discord-Bot
Bot for scraping reddit data and making it available in discord

Requires a config file to actually work.
It is not included here as it contains private Tokens and User data.

Download files to a local folder and run:

- npm install discord.js

- npm install snoowrap

Ask Almighty Malgus for any config files or create your own accordingly for local testing.
