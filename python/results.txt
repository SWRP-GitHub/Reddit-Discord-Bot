BodyText: *"-we have a* ***disaster*** *on our hands."*   


It was the forty-eighth time today she had heard that phrase. This, however, was the first she was hearing it from her immediate superior. "Yes, I understand, Count Almorus. I *will* have the situation resolved by the time of your return, one way or another.  I will be conducting the interrogation myself to ensure accuracy and precision in all things. You needn't worry any further, enjoy your trip to Vorzyd Five." With that and before she could hear a response, she flipped the switch off her communicator and took it out of her ear for a brief moment to clean it.   


Inspector Katskee Snowfarr, originally from Northern Serenno. She read as she flipped through the file that had been compiled on her desk. Sparse details on her childhood. Doesn't consistently appear in records until enrolling in police academy and being assigned to an Investigations Unit in a small town of around 10,000. A few local cases, a prominent bust here and there. Near flawless performance. Enough to earn her a fast pass through training.  "*That is, until she went on an unauthorized mission and proceeded to level an abandoned hotel and lead to dozens of deaths, both of her fellow agents and a number of criminal cartel members."* She furrowed her brow, closing the file and making her way to the door, stepping outside her office with the gorgeous Carannia sunrise just reaching its zenith behind her.   


"Mr Atrobi? Send a notice to Holding, move Inspector Snowfarr to Interrogations. A-Class. But..." Her mind pulsed with a half-formed thought, both entertained and dismissed in equal measure as she cast a glare her secretary was all too familiar with. "...prepare a G-Class Chamber in the event she proves... uncooperative. Or worse."  


\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  


  
Forty minutes later, she was walking down the hallways of a nearby building. Holding for VIPs and... *special...* guests. She approached two guards, flashed her I.D, and watched the stereotypical flash of white across their faces as they hurriedly ushered her through the checkpoint. It was another ten minutes making her way towards A-Block, during which time she heard over her comlink that Inspector Snowfarr had been transferred to A-4 and was awaiting interrogation. After finally reaching A-Block, she was greeted by three surprised guards- one transfer, two local, and...  


"Chief Inspector, here to see if your lamb is being brought to slaughter?" An eyebrow was raised at Chief Inspector Divenaus, head of Inspector Snowfarr's division.    


"O- oh! Ma'am! No- I mean yes, I mean-. Well, No but yes." The startled man in black suit and tie quickly tried to adjust his slicked back hair that, no matter how hard he tried, always parted wildly at the back. "Three agents dead, one in critical condition- it's... My division lost some of the best hands I've worked with in years, ma'am. We're fighting an uphill battle and I cannot afford to lose a good agent if-"  


"If you can help it, I've heard this line before, Divenaus. A good set of hands, however, does not raid evidence and engage in an unauthorized mission leaving her trainee with the equivalent of a ***post-it-note***. There is something going on, and I will be getting to the bottom of this- now, A-4. Down the hall, to the left. Divenaus, you are free to watch from Observation. Now, if you excuse me, I have an interrogation to begin.   


\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  


For Katskee Snowfarr, the transfer from Holding to "Interrogation" was smooth and quiet, not a word uttered as she was ushered into, had she might of not known better, would have been assumed to be a break room, with comfortable looking leather seats, a low, stylish metal table bolted to the floor, and small tray arrayed with small bottled waters, crackers, bags of thinly sliced vegetable matter lightly air-fried, and small plastic cups with pouches of flavorings. A clock mounted into the beige-painted brick wall was the only sound beyond hers in this room. Two doors were the only points of entry and exit , one which she had entered, and another directly opposite to it.   


Twelve minutes later, on the dot, from that opposite door strode a human woman with dark skin, wearing an all-black suit with no tie, unbuttoned at the front so it parted almost like a trench coat. Aside from the short, tied back hair the only feature of note was a fairly major one- a sort of metallic plate that covered where a left eye should be, affixed with surgical precision and a few clamps and   
metallic bands that circled her head.  


"Inspector Katskee Snowfarr, a shame we have to meet under such unpleasant circumstances. I am  Anellia Ira, Minister of Security. We have some things to discuss."

Title: A Safe Haven
PostID: sork66

BodyText: Cain limped out of the cantina, looking over his shoulder as he walked further down the cold Ord Mantell street. People didn’t seem to bat an eye at him, though people who looked like him probably weren’t a rarity on planets like these. He hoped no one noticed the credits practically falling out of his pockets but, at least for the time being, he was more than capable of defending himself. At least as long as the adrenaline kept pumping. 

He reached down to the blaster wound that graced his abdomen and winced at it before continuing down the street, trying to get as far from the cantina as possible. He didn’t even know the name of the gang that had tried to double-cross him, but they knew him and his face. He had to get off the street soon, somewhere inconspicuous. He could try to get a room at a hotel or something but that would raise eyebrows. A warehouse would better suit his needs he realised and he decided to cut through a side alley. He doubted there would be any warehouses on the main street coming in from the port. 

He heard shouting coming from behind him and he unholstered the blaster, keeping it at his side for now. He didn’t know how much of a head start he was expecting, but he had hoped it would’ve been longer than that. The alley grew darker as he hurriedly limped down it, his eyes constantly darting over his shoulder to make sure they weren’t behind him. Coming out of the alleyway into a well lit but significantly less busy road, he decided to turn left out of the alley and head back in the direction of the port. 

He continued to head down different alleyways for some time, trying his damndest to lose any gangsters that might be following him. He eventually came across a small and seemingly abandoned warehouse, sheet metal and boards across its windows. Cain reached to the control pad and attempted to open it, finding it to be locked. *Kriff,* he thought, considering his options. He wasn’t an experienced slicer by any means, but he had picked up some tricks when he lived on the streets of Eriadu. He knelt down beside it and then realised he didn’t even have a vibroknife to open up the panel with. He let out a groan and stood back up, pulling his blaster out of its holster. He looked from side to side to check that the alley was empty before he pressed the barrel to the panel and pulled the trigger, sending multiple bolts into it until the door slid open. 

Cain quickly slipped through the opening and looked around for anything to cover it. Finding a discarded metal sheet, he flung it over the door and prayed to whatever was out there that no one would try to enter the building. The interior of the warehouse was devoid of any decoration or emotion. Slivers of the light from the street shone through the cracks of the shuttered windows far above him, dimly illuminating the empty room. He saw a catwalk up towards where he supposed a second floor would be and a ladder that was missing a few rungs leading up to it. He decided to take his chances and climbed up the ladder, managing to drag himself up to the catwalk before the radiating pain from his torso really began to hit him. 

He doubled over on the metal grating and held his side, trying to remain as still as possible so the pain would stop shooting through his insides. He slowly reached up to his face and peeled the bacta bandage from the claw marks on his jaw and lifted his shirt to replace it there. He groaned loudly as what bacta remained got to work on the wound and he forced himself up onto his feet and further along the catwalk. Ahead of him, he saw a few doors, though in the dim lighting he struggled to see further than that. He opened the first door he came to and slammed it shut behind him. He slid down in front of the door and slipped the blaster out of its holster before resting it on his lap, gripping the handle loosely. 

He slid his eyes shut and attempted to get any form of sleep before heading back out onto the street in the morning.

Title: A Quiet Stroll

BodyText: For a city that was stuffed to the brim full of people, there was a shocking lack of them out on the streets - if you weren't familiar with the slums of Nar Shaddaa. Jaesa, of course, was, and that was exactly why she liked going on walks - there was nobody around. Nobody to bother her, in contrast to the crowded tenements she was forced to live in most of the time, at least when she could get the credits to afford rent. Out here, she had space to move, even if it was a space full of blinding neon lights, foul smells, and thugs, oftentimes gangsters working *for* rather than against the local government. 

There wasn’t much reason other than that to be out here, though. She caught the sight of a bright green neon sign out of the corner of her eye, one she’d seen dozens of times before yet never entered. When most of your biological functions were regulated by extensive cybernetics, after all, your palette was far too expansive - and relaxed - for *buying* food to be necessary. Most of the time, anyways - when she did, it usually meant buying huge quantities of bland foods in bulk. Most things tasted like nothing, anyways.

Jaesa didn’t mind the thugs, either. With her eyes constantly moving from side to side, up and down, her head twitching back and forth, few people *wanted* to approach her, and she was usually too alert to be ambushed. Her bionic ears picked up and pinpointed every set of footsteps in her vicinity, informing her who was on a collision course, which sets of footsteps were hurried or matched a set of characteristics that indicated panic... One such set moved past her, and she turned to see a panicking togruta, carrying a bag of groceries in his arms. He didn’t pay her any notice, and she didn’t pay him much either, wondering whether he was running from or to something. A dinner he had to prepare for that he was running late for, maybe? Most people she knew didn’t cook, but a few managed to find the time and money. A few, but definitely not her. She was usually too busy drinking, huffing spice, or running from the Hutts, and cooking was horribly *boring* anyways. She didn’t-

Her eyes glanced up to see something glinting on a rooftop from a handful of blocks away, a few inches up from its lip. It shifted, and then it was gone.

*A blaster scope*, she thought, silently cursing to herself. Her eyes now set themselves to look for cover, rather than simply enemies - resilient as she was, if there was a sniper after her, there could be - and probably were - more guns pointed at her than she realized. Suddenly, her eyes fell upon an alleyway off to her left in which sat a pair of large dumpsters, and it was then that she heard the sound of sprinting feet. Not just one, or two, or five... The sheer number made it sound like at least a dozen. *That* was a problem, so without giving it another moment of thought, Jaesa dove sideways into the alleyway, a searing blue bolt buzzing by her ear as she tumbled into a pile of garbage, scrambling to get behind the dumpster. Angry, shouting voices followed her, getting closer by the moment, Jaesa’s head darting back and forth, struggling to think. She had cover, but as she’d learned numerous times before, dumpsters weren’t blasterproof, more like... Briefly blaster-resistant. Worse, she could already feel the adrenaline pumping through her veins, urging her to *kill*. Fighting, she didn’t have an issue with, but with so many of these Hutt mercenaries with so many *certainly lethal* blasters on hand...

The alleyway, unfortunately, only had one exit, and she was certain the sniper saw her dive into it. That meant she had only one way to go if she wanted to avoid a massacre. 

Up. 

Punching her fingers into the wall she was leaning against, she began to clamber up it, step by step, aiming to get onto the roof. In a handful of seconds, she was already a handful of feet up...

Then her head turned toward the sound of boots moving into the alleyway, and the grizzled, wickedly scarred mask she saw sent cortisol shooting through her bloodstream. The red x-mark across a shiny golden helm, the small handful of scratches along its left side, the large, fanged “teeth’ ornamenting the space where a mouth would have been... She remembered that mask, wielding an electro-last, cackling as left her and her mother convulsing on the floor.

She didn’t know the name of the monster that wore it, but she didn’t need to.

*Fuck it*, she thought, activating the chemical engines that sent cocktails of combat drugs through her system, everything from hyper-adrenals to simple stims.

Taking in a deep breath, she turned, and lunged, the powerful pistons in her already enhanced legs launching her further than any natural twi’lek could go. She collided with the masked slavebreaker with enough force to knock him backwards, his skull colliding with the ground with a sickening *crack*, blood oozing from the wound. He was probably going to die like that, but that wasn’t enough. Jaesa needed a weapon. Feeling for his arm, she felt her fingers touch metal, and then, as hard as she could, she *pulled*.

In an instant, the flesh and artificial fibers holding his arm into his shoulder tore and snapped, all while Jaesa watched the limb rip free of his shoulder, her enhanced vision offering her a close-up view of each and every stressed fiber.

A bladed heel to the face ended that quickly enough, crushing his skull and everything within into a thick, pinkish paste. For good measure, she stomped on his skull once, twice more, until there was nothing recognizable left, his menacing mask little but shattered shards of golden ceramic.

“Come ON, you kriffing bastards! Come and get me, if you want me so damn badly!” She shouted, tearing the slaver’s blaster from his arm. A quick glance at the weapon told her all she needed to know. Fully loaded. 


Wielding the slaver’s limb - and blaster, Jaesa rocketed out into the street, whipped the blaster around to the right - and fired, squeezing the trigger. In a handful of moments, she dumped the blaster carbine into where she assumed the sniper was. A scream followed, but by then, she'd already discarded the thing. 

Her head jerked back-and-forth, a blue bolt uselessly splattering over her right shoulder. The shapes of men resolved into her sight as infrared ghosts, sheltered behind pieces of scattered cover - garbage cans, dumpsters, illegally parked airspeeders. Time seemed to slow to a crawl as her reaction enhancers kicked into gear, a second cocktail of neurostimulants dumping into her blood from one of the glands hidden deep within her body. 

*Ten left. On the money.*

The ones to the west - her left - were closer. 


Jaesa whipped around to face that side, dropping low, and then abruptly shot into a sprint, the poorly maintained street beneath cracking at the surface. The rush Jaesa felt as she charged toward the mercenaries in cover, the fragile little men that thought they were safe - it was exhilarating. She moved faster than any of them could, bobbing and weaving up and down and side to side to keep them from getting a bead on her, while those few stunning bolts that did strike her were rendered useless by the powerful drugs coursing through her system. She might not have been wealthy, of course, but she'd still managed to make a few upgrades to her bionics in the years since she'd escaped. Just enough to keep going. 

Eight feet away from the mercenaries, she saw them fiddling with their blasters; it was only thanks to her enhanced vision that she saw it was the adjustment knobs for their carbines. They'd finally figured out they weren't going to be able to take her alive. 

*Too late,* Jaesa thought... And just in time, a blaster bolt whizzed over her head from behind. 

She brought her hands up, and the air around her palms began to vibrate. Suddenly, out shot a powerful wave of repulsive force - and down the mercenaries went, tossed to the ground like ragdolls along with their cover, crates and cans in neat piled now scattered across the road. Jaesa didn't waste any time. 

Letting out a howling scream, she launched herself at the first Gank, repulsorfist thrumming with gravitic force. Her fingers shot through his chestplate, digging deep puts into his chest, through his ribcage... And out came his still-beating heart, moments after popped like an overripe grape in her palm. Jumping back to her feet, Jaesa swiftly turned on the rest of them, her impromptu bludgeon smashing the face of another of them with casual ease. It, like the Gank’s face, cracked in half like a dry twig - and Jaesa discarded it with a frustrated grunt, jamming her fingers into the man's chest to use his body as a shield, hiding behind it as blaster bolts smashed into him, briefly filling Jaesa’s nostrils with the acrid stench of burning flesh before they tuned it out.

Her piercing gaze focused on the two slave-catchers to her left, Jaesa threw the half-broken arm on one of her hands at the remaining Gank on her right, and dropped the body, breaking into a lightning-fast sprint yet again. The mercenaries were all too close. Close enough that she closed with the first of the two of them before he even had the chance to pull his trigger. All Jaesa had to do to finish with him was hold up her arm, repulsor-fingers stretched out for his face. Her middle-finger punched through his eye, crushing it, and gripped the bone of his eye-socket, literally ripping his skull in half, leaving his brains to spill out of his broken, obliterated skull onto the pavement like a shattered egg. The next one froze at the display - hesitated for just a fraction of a second... And dropped to his knees, shaking and sobbing, while Jaesa turned to see the rest of the hired guns running in the opposite direction, cursing and swearing under their breath.

“Pul-please!” He sputtered in Huttese, his artificial voice warped and distorted by the tumult of his distress, hands held above his head.

“Don’t do this! Don’t kill me! I’ll tell you whatever you want to know, please! Anything.”

Jaesa scoffed, bending down as she placed a hand on either side of his cheeks, pushing inward.

“You’ll tell me anything I want to know, huh?”

He nodded. She couldn’t see behind his mask, but she knew he was sobbing nonetheless.

“I already know everything I need to.”

With another grunt, she slammed her forehead against his, shattering his armored mask. She felt his forehead begin to break beneath hers, hairline fractures spidering out into thick cracks - and then it broke, just like the rest of him, and his body fell limp to the ground, while Jaesa reached down to grab his blaster carbine, swiveling around to look back over her shoulder at the fleeing shapes.

Title: A Family Bank

BodyText: The wrinkled, beady-eyed holo of Itzlaz Carmanos huffed at the semi-circle of banking directors seated before his image. He was supposed to be in retirement on Dremulae, indulging in Corellian whiskey and his newest fiancée, and yet here he was, judging a slate of hedge strategies and relegating them to the trash compactor. "Alright, I've heard enough. Let's leave it there, shall we?"

He must have woken up on the right side of the bed this morning, for it was his usual style to chew somebody out in the face of collective failure. He used to always claim that *no bad deed should go unpunished* in a convenient alteration of the aphorism for a banking magnate, let alone a father. The directors, mostly human men but some women too, mumbled their consent, grateful that none of them had been targeted. They only rose after their revered former leader said, "Thank you, everybody. We'll circle back in two months' time."

Nere went to stand as well until she heard Itzlaz call out her name with that paternal tone every child learned to resent: "*Nere*, stay for a minute, will you?"

*Son of a ruskakk*. "Of course, father." A few sympathetic glances from the door were the only consolation she would get as the middle-aged heiress was abandoned to her fate. She tucked in her brown hair behind her citrine-burdened ear, dusted her violet satin pantsuit, and cocked her chin, anxious but prepared for a verbal walloping.

"I'm disappointed, Nere." *The traditional opening salvo*. "I thought I made myself clear that I wanted a *speculative* play, but all I see here is hedge after hedge. A [bear put spread](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bearputspread.asp) on Avirex, Alsakan asset [securitizations](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/securitization.asp)? What part of speculative didn't you understand?"

"Well," Nere started off meekly, "you heard Koltan. We thought that with our gains from the Horizon [arbitrage](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/trading/04/111004.asp) and the obvious consolidation issues ahead that we'd be better off if we—"

"Hedged?" His brow sank to new depths as fury infiltrated his wrinkles.

"Preserved our gains," she retorted. *Kiss your job goodbye, Koltan*. 

"*Preserved our gains*," Itzlaz repeated, tasting the trite words with a sarcastic tongue. "Sounds like krayt spit to me. You've been rubbing shoulders too much with the Muuns. Tell me, are our quarterly [AUMs](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/aum.asp) rising or falling?"

She sighed. "Rising."

"What about our [ROA](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/returnonassets.asp)?"

"I get it, *dad*."

"I don't think you do, *darling*, or else you wouldn't have wasted the last hour feeding me Bantha feces. And don't pin this on Koltan. The man can't see over the hedge. It's *your* job to know better."

*That was rich*. Nere crossed her arms and slouched back in her chair. "And how am I supposed to know anything, let alone do my job, when you keep me in the dark?" 

"I briefed you and gave you specific instructions—"

"To make a speculative play, *I know*, but without any indication as to what the overarching strategy was. What's the Council planning? What are we working towards?" Though a Sovereign in name, the Council had conveniently excluded Nere from [their last gathering](https://www.reddit.com/r/Starwarsrp/comments/pfm7cw/waltz_of_the_limitless/) on account of her father's invitation. 

"Prosperity for Corellia, what else?" Itzlaz avoided her gaze then, and for a moment she was sure he was lying until she heard the faint voice of a woman ten years younger than her. *Runa*, the sixth in a succession of parasites hoping to outlive her father. "Look, I have to go," he said as a small hand appeared on the holo and slid down his shoulder. "You've got your meeting with Orson in a week. Come up with something new by then — a [currency swap](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/currencyswap.asp) or something. Make it speculative! And uh, don't forget to deal with the man's labor issue. That's your specialty."

Nere sulked, not that it amounted to much. He wasn't paying attention to her. "Yep. Got it." 

"Bye Nerey-deary!" Runa added before the line was cut.

As the holo dissolved, the light sconces brightened. Nere slank forward onto her hands and elbows, exasperated, but like clockwork, her assistant popped in through the door, robbing her of reprieve.

"Ma'am? Your five o'clock?" Oto chimed. "It's in three minutes." 

"*Reschedule it,*" she mumbled. 

"Sorry?" 

"Reschedule it!" she shouted from her hands. She had no recollection of whom she was even supposed to meet.

This was not the first time Oto had to handle his boss. He was tall and lanky, but had long raven hair and roguishly handsome features that Nere was fond of. That and a bottomless pit of patience. "On it. And the soiree?" 

Nere straightened up. "I forgot about the soiree. Cancel it," she begrudgingly instructed. "I can't afford the time." 

Now that surprised Oto. "Are you sure? You look like you could use a drink. No offense."

Nere craned her neck towards Oto and smiled sheepishly. "Maybe you're right." Like her father said, it was her job to *know* better, not to do better. "Keep the soiree on then, but get me a team of five associates, let's say two associate directors, and a director. *Not* Koltan! Mirena. Mirena should be good. I like her. Approve them for a week's overtime, and you can tell them I don't care what clients they're already working on."

"Shall I have them meet for nine tomorrow?" 

"No, twelve." She finally stood. Her thighs screamed from stiffness. "Like you said, I could *really* use a drink."

Title: Walls Of The Institution

&nbsp;

*The Institution, Argai Minor*

*299 ABY*

&nbsp;

Lilith opened her eyes slowly, without bearings nor track of time.  Greeting her to consciousness, the aggressive lights of her bare room forced her into an uncomfortable squint, and the sound of screaming somewhere down the hallway reminded her of where she was.

Nothing else registered.

With difficulty, Lilith took two deep breaths in an attempt to chase away the dizziness, somewhat successfully.  When she sat upright, however, it came back with a vengeance, so much that it threatened to topple her over from her sitting position.  She lied back down.

For long minutes did the agent remain uselessly prostrated on her bed, her mind too hazy, unable to move to action.  The screaming still hadn’t stopped, and by now Lilith had learned from experience that it might not for a long time.  The resident’s voice would give before the Institution would.  It was starting to unnerve her, this screaming, like a reminder that it was only a matter of time before she reached that point herself.  It was constant, omnipresent, always emanating from one room or another, whenever a patient went into a crisis and was left unattended.  The worst were the times when screaming in one room triggered screaming in the neighbouring ones, spreading across the floor, a cacophony of madness that fed upon itself, stronger and stronger.  They all would join it, eventually.  The Institution would see to it.  How long did she have left before she, too, was driven to insanity beyond repair?

Lilith knew she would take her lullaby long before then.

It was that thought that finally whipped the agent to move. She stood, nervously caressing the blue metallic bracelet around her left wrist.  She couldn’t take the easy way out, not when she still had a mission unfinished.  It was even bigger than her duty to the Sovereignty, now.  Lilith would bring down this place even if it was the last thing she did with her life.

Dragging her feet across the room, Lilith set to recover the complex, scattered pieces of metal she had snuck inside and concealed within her hard mattress, the most predictable place in the world but the only one available in this otherwise barren room she had been assigned, and shoved them into the loose pocket of her medcenter gown.  By then, her head had cleared enough.  Despite days - weeks? - of treatment at the hands of the Institution, Lilith found her thoughts were still serviceable, her movements still reasonably sharp and precise.  She had the brilliant inventors of PEC to thank for it, for designing this technology that shielded her mind, kept it her own against the assault of whatever was shot into her body every evening.  It wouldn’t hold forever, already she was feeling the effects more day after day, but it granted her time.  Now, it was up to her to put it to good use and finally overcome this slump in her investigation.  No more dead ends.

Ready for another duel with the Institution, Lilith slipped out of her bare grey room and into the bare grey hallways, the screaming still ringing in her ears, louder and louder.

&nbsp;

___

&nbsp;

From the moment Lilith had first set her eyes inside the Institution, flanked by two guards, she had known something was off.

There had been a few doctors and nurses going around, noting doses and behaviours in those datapads of theirs, but it was the number of guards that had done it.  A few of them were necessary, Lilith had understood that; in a place like this one, patients would need to be restrained occasionally.  But not that many.  And not armed like that.

In the first corridor they had strode through, from the entrance to the mess hall, Lilith had come across three, not counting her own escort.  They wielded heavy blaster rifles, and a threatening tactical knife hung at their waist.  They also wore bulky pieces of armor; although not a full suit akin to a stormtrooper’s, their chest, arms, and shins were protected against… what, exactly?  Kicks and bites from a difficult patient in psychosis?

These were no care facility guards.  These were soldiers.

Following her escort, Lilith had arrived at the mess hall.  Two more soldiers had been standing guard there, with several residents eating dinner.  Lilith’s eyes had zoomed on one of them, in the middle of the open room.  She had watched him dunk a spoon into his bowl of soup, then bring it halfway to his eyes, concentrating.  Slowly, slowly, he had tipped the spoon over, letting the soup drip in a growing puddle on the table, drop by drop, watching in utter fascination.  Just as Lilith had turned the corner to the second hallway on the left, she’d seen him go for another spoonful.

That new hallway had been lined up with what had appeared to be the residents’ rooms.  None of them had a door.  That was when Lilith had heard screaming for the first time in her stay, coming from a room ahead on her left.  As she was escorted further down the corridor, she’d stolen a look through the doorless opening.  A woman had been lying on the floor, screeching at the top of her lungs, twisting her muscles wildly in every direction, restrained by a straitjacket.  Lilith had only seen her for a second before she had walked past her room, but she remembered the woman sinking her teeth into her own shoulder, the only part of herself that she could reach, drawing a gush of blood.  She had screamed in pain then, even louder than before.  Neither the guards nor the nurse a few meters down the hall had seemed to care. Finally, Lilith had been directed to an empty room on her right, and the guards had left her alone to return to their post.

They hadn’t even checked her for weapons.

Quickly, Lilith had gone to her bed, to the side of her mattress that wasn’t visible from the door, and torn a seam open.  There, she’d hidden the small, elaborate metal pieces she had brought along with her, with the crystal last.  Her deed done, she had stripped and changed into one of the gowns she had been handed at the entrance, and had left her clothes on the floor, as instructed.  

It hadn’t been long before she’d heard footsteps coming for her.  Lilith had stared at the nurse in the eyes before the woman had even fully entered her room, which had caused her to start.  She’d been carrying a syringe.

“Miss Orum,” the nurse had addressed her with a smile.  Her voice hadn’t even been threatening.  “Your medicine for tonight.”

The first time, Lilith hadn’t resisted.  She’d figured playing along was her only option, if she were to lead this mission to success. She’d offered her arm willingly.  That had changed, in the following days.  To no avail.  Every night had ended the same way.

Whatever was in there had not been medicine.  H4b sedative, or tranqarest, potentially, but mixed with… something else.  The dizziness had hit first, then the loss of control over her limbs, her thoughts.  Her head had been heavy.  In the end, despite her augmentations, despite her gift, Lilith had collapsed to the darkness, just like everyone did.

In the following days, she’d gotten to work, racing against her dwindling time.

She’d started with mapping out the floor where she stayed.  The mess hall was at the center, with a kitchen adjacent to it that was inaccessible to residents.  Five hallways led into it; one to the building’s entrance, three lined up with identical rooms where the residents slept, and the last one was remote, sinuous, watched over by two holocameras along its path.  She hadn’t gone near it, at first, not until she’d grown more desperate for clues.  

On this floor, Lilith had soon realized that every single resident was marked with a blue bracelet just like hers, no exceptions.  She’d found out quickly enough that her integrated slicing assistant could easily go through its rudimentary electronic systems to open it, but there was no point.  In the Institution, this blue bracelet made her almost invisible.  With it, residents wandered freely, aimlessly across the floor, from one room to another, through the mess hall, the hallways, and guards barely even looked at them.

Blue meant regular admission.  Severe mental patient.  Crazy.  Harmless.

With hers, Lilith had strolled throughout the floor, leaving her PEC-designed adhesive bugs in strategic emplacements, each smaller than a grain of rice.  The first one, she’d left under the admissions table in the antechamber, the very first day she’d arrived.  She’d stuck one under the counter between the mess hall and the kitchen, hoping to overhear something interesting from the staff; another she’d put by the first turbolift, the one that carried administrative personnel to their office.  None of them had borne fruit.  And every night, Lilith faced her injection, driving her closer and closer to madness, farther and farther from her objective.

It had taken some time for Lilith to approach the final hallway, but eventually, she’d had no choice, using her new eyes to pass unseen through the holocameras’ field of view.  At the end of it was a turbolift; Lilith had tried to slice her way through its access, but she’d been denied.  She hadn’t tried her luck again, fearing an alarm.  But she knew she’d found the key.

Deep down, below the lift, she’d sensed something.  Someone.

She’d understood.

&nbsp;

___

&nbsp;

As she often did, Lilith began with the mess hall.

There wasn’t much there, she knew, but she didn’t dare approach the restricted turbolift or the administrative section again, lest she attract suspicion or trigger an alert.  Besides, it was pointless.  Her hands couldn’t slice them open.

Around her, a few residents were sitting sparsely by the long tables with a guard distractedly watching over them, and a nurse was making her way to one of the corridors where residents had their rooms.  The two residents closest to Lilith were exchanging empty, soulless laughs.  There was no joke that seemed to trigger it - one would begin the ugly, guttural sounds, and the other would stop to listen; then, the one laughing would stop and the other would pick it up in his place, and the cycle would repeat, neverending.

*At least they’re not screaming*, Lilith thought.

Before she could bring her focus elsewhere and start formulating a plan, there was static in her ear, and Lilith heard a voice she recognized.

“Extraordinary admission, I take it?”

That was her bug in the antechamber.  Hadn’t the guard used the exact same words, the days she’d arrived?

“That’s right,” said another voice, farther.  “Got a real treat for you.  Name’s Colsair Fortunaro.  Colonel in the navy, can you imagine?”

There was typing.

“Colsair Fortunaro,” the guard confirmed.  “Guilty of corruption, high treason, distribution of military secrets, and conspiracy against the person of Arthur Xadran himself.  Well, that’s quite the record, isn’t that right, mister Fortunaro?”

No answer.

“Well, you’ll use that tongue of yours soon enough,” rose the same voice.  “I’m sure you’ll find the Institution to your taste… eventually.”

Lilith stood, abandoning her place in the mess hall to stand by one of the corners, waiting.

Three men walked across the Institution, much like Lilith remembered doing on the day of her arrival.  One guard in front, one guard behind, and in the middle, Colsair Fortunaro, traitor to the Carida Authority and conspirator against Arthur Xadran, docilely followed just as she had.  Unlike Lilith, however, his bracelet was a bright red.  And when the impromptu procession crossed the mess hall, ignoring the hallways that led to the rooms used by the regular admissions, the agent knew her suspicions were correct.  She knew where they were headed.

The trio made for the other hallway, the remote one that led to the restricted turbolift.  Seizing the cameras’ eyes for her own, Lilith stalked their progression around corners, sequentially freezing each of the two holocameras along its arc for one crucial second to allow her to slip past unnoticed, following the group from a distance.  When at last they reached the final the part of the hallway that ended with the lift’s door, she moved closer.  Lilith peeked around the last bend with her own eyes, calculating the distance between her and the nearest guard.

She pounced.

Lilith broke into a sprint.  When the first guard heard her footsteps and turned his head towards her, she was already on him.  She tackled him and drew the knife at his belt in one fluid motion as the two tumbled to the ground together.  Lilith landed on top and plunged the knife into his carotid.

By then, the second guard had turned around and was raising his blaster.  Lilith dove forward and rolled, slipping between his legs.  Before he could react, she was standing behind him and drawing his knife as well.  Her left hand clamped down on his mouth, hard, muffling his scream as she ran the blade across his throat.  When he stopped struggling in her arms, she let him slump to the floor, followed by the knife.

“Colsair Fortunaro”, she hailed the grey-haired man with his flaming red bracelet.  “Give me your arm.”

The only man left alive looked around, ready to listen or run, unsure what to make of this black demon in her bloodied medcenter gown who had just apparently rescued him.  In the end, he obeyed.

Lilith brought her right hand to his wrist, and the bracelet clicked open.  She did the same with hers.  As she spoke, she traded them, locking her blue one around Colsair’s wrist and his red one around her own.

“Wear this bracelet, act a bit confused, and no guard on this level will bat an eye at you,” she explained, hurriedly but clearly.  “Go back the way you came, back to the mess hall.  There’ll be four corridors, two on each side.  Go down the first one on the right.  The tenth door on the right will be my room, it’ll be empty.  You can wait there until the alarms ring.  When you hear the blaster fire, come out and look for me.  Understood?”

Colsair didn’t need to be told twice.  He nodded and turned around, going back the way he came.  When he disappeared past the corner, Lilith got to work.

One by one, she dragged the two bodies to the door of the restricted turbolift, leaving an obvious bloody trail that she could do nothing about.  Then, she crouched over the body of the second guard, the one who had been in front, and found his credentials in the usual place, the inside pocket of his vest.  When she presented the datacard to the reader next to the turbolift, its door slid open.

Lilith brought the two bodies with her inside the lift, hoping to buy a bit more time before they were inevitably discovered.  She’d crossed the point of no return, now.  Everything came down to this.  Before long, the two guards’ absence would be noticed, or another one would stumble upon the bloody mess she’d left, and the Institution would be placed on high alert.  If she was lucky, it could be hours; if she wasn’t, it would be minutes.  By then, if she hadn’t her answers and her way out, it would be the end of her.

Either way, she wouldn’t spend another night at the Institution, Lilith thought as the turbolift brought her down to the restricted lower levels and the secrets she sought.  She would walk free, or she would die before she was caught.

The thought was freeing, somehow.

BodyText: *[Monolith Station](https://imgur.com/A8FVwNk), Corellia.*

*13:00 Standard Corellian Time.*

Several beads of sweat threatened to fall from Crixus's brows and into his eyes, and more than one had already fallen from the tip of his sharp nose. His breathing pattern was heavy from exertion, even as the air entered and exited his lungs in a timed, rhythmic fashion. His muscles had begun aching a half-standard hour ago, and there was a slight pulsing headache growing behind his forehead. The Corellian forced himself to ignore the discomforts and press onward with his exercises.

Both hands gripped the staff of the long, double bladed lightsaber, sometimes alternating the grip between fore and under, then back again. Choking up, then widening the grip, depressing one blade before transitioning to the other - there was so much more to controlling a double sided blade than the undiscerning eye might initially consider, and while Crixus had practiced with vibrostaffs in the past, a lightsaber of this caliber was a new beast to be mastered.

Crixus grunted as he twisted his waist back and forth, holding the blade to perform a series of horizontal cuts to the left and right. He was alone in his private hangar, there were no training droids or auto-blasters needed yet - better to reach for mastery over the kinetic movements that came with the weapon *before* entering a combat arena.

"All in due time," Crixus told himself as he finally allowed himself to relax, deactivating both ends of the ancient Sith lightsaber as he did so. With the weapon no longer lethal, he placed his hands on his hips and looked up at the ceiling panels of the hangar while sucking in several long, cool breaths of air. He followed this up by using the back of his hand to wipe away the sweat that had gathered on his face as he turned towards the hangar exit and made his way through the blast door and out into the hall. His breathing pattern slowly normalized as he made his way to his room, sealing the door behind him as he did so.

A shower came next. Stripping off his training tunic, Crixus stepped under the steaming hot water and let it rain down upon him for several moments. Once the heat became too much, he used the control panel to switch the water to ice cold, and he would go on to alternate the water temperature back and forth like this as he applied antibacterial soap to his body. He enjoyed the feeling of moving between both extremes, but he always ended his showers ice cold again before stepping out and toweling himself dry.

His dark, wet hair lay slick against his scalp as he looked at himself in the mirror. His blue, artificially enhanced eyes shined in a mesmerizing way when he looked directly at them, it was strangely pleasant, in its own uncanny way. He used his hands to comb his hair backward while he gazed at his reflection, lost in rumination. This time alone was comforting - it reminded him of what it had been like growing up on *Monolith,* where the quiet of his room was one of the only places he felt peace, when his uncle wasn't leering over him and harshly judging whatever task he had been given.

After some time, Crixus stepped back out into the hall, now wearing a fresh, fitted tunic with long sleeves that was held tight around his waist by a leather belt. A pair of dark pants and boots completed the outfit, while in his right hand Crixus held his scepter of power, the lightsaber bestowed upon him by the Acolytes of the Beyond. The last week spent with Sierra and Woad had proven fruitful - Crixus was now equipped with clandestine knowledge of the Acolyte's existence and motives - but they had returned to their places in the shadows of society, fearful of the retribution that would befall them at the hands of Dumenaris Payne, should they reveal their treacherous allegiance to Crixus too soon. In the meantime, Crixus needed to ensure that his new compatriots - Julia Verence and Jhoro Daraay - could be trusted and, in the the case of the latter, could be of any use at all.

Crixus strode through the halls of the Payne family estate, making a steady circuit around the main thoroughfare in search of Julia. In the last week, he hadn't seen or spoke to either her or Jhoro, but the estate droids and AI had kept him relatively appraised of their activities. If Crixus had to guess, the former Jedi would likely be enjoying herself at the pool, sipping from a bartended glass, maybe catching up on some of Corellia's renowned holovid hits. Wherever she was, though, Crixus intended to find her this evening. The two of them were about to become better acquainted, though, not in the way that one would likely expect...

Title: Peace and Disturbance
PostID: sjf8yg

BodyText: It's an amusing thing, what people will do with the things that are left behind from those they loved. Most sell off what remains, or cover and hide it away, not embracing the hurt and longing they desperately try to push deep down. Others honor them by passing on what was most cherished to those select few descendants, as a way to keep that one's memory going in the hearts and minds of those that come later. Some erect monuments of their likeness, to show a fraction of their persona, as big as in life as in passing. What the survivors do with the things someone leaves behind, shows how well they were cared for in life, and how much they are missed. 


Orson, thoughtless as the dust of the cosmos, dug his hands deep into the soil, carefully removing the formerly small bonsai into a holding pot, and refilled the vacant hole until a solid enough surface remained. Finished and satisfied, he pushed the cart carrying the tree across the atrium that opened up to the stars above, to the larger soil bed, to replant the tree among its larger extended family. It didn't take long, and once the smaller tree dwarfed by the much larger curving greenery had been planted firmly, he moved to the next task, which was trimming and cutting the bindings of one of the larger coniferous trees. Climbing carefully to stand in the soil bed, small shears in hand, he patiently began to trim the bindings from the trunk. 


Orson wiped the small beads of perspiration from his brow with the back of the soft glove, as he looked over his work in front of him. 
"I haven't even tackled the Orchid gallery yet, and you still keep me busy, even after all these years." he said, as he glanced up to the heavens above. The garden had never been his idea. His true passion had always been his work, his business deals, accumulating the holdings he grasped through his company, and the groundwork he laid for the next journey of rising higher and higher. It wasn't something that kept him humble, he didn't sweat at the brow or physically reach into dirt to acquire what he had achieved. And so when his wife requested a wing of the building Orson held his office in, he obliged, thinking nothing of it. Days went by, and months, and Orson would always become curious why his secretary would bring shipping manifests to him of things he didn't order. It wasn't until he got curious and decided to learn for himself why she requested an entire wing did he discover what she was spending her time on. A garden, lush with every kind of plant that could be imagined in his mind, was planted, or in the process of. Even then she was sick, unknown to them, but through her sickness she requested this, to have something to humble her, and to be closer to Orson. She never told him it was so she could be close by him, to be there as he left his office, to spend whatever ending days she could, to savor every minute that was afforded her. While he worked, she tended her garden, and raised it to be beautiful, and equal to his own achievements in stature. There was not a day that Orson did not work in his late wife's creation of living art that he did not break down, from just the memory of her tending to these things, waiting idly for him to come to her as he departed for the night. 

This place broke him everyday that he came here, enough so that he sat in the soil, and wept. As he did now. 


He absolutely could have people to tend the garden, but they did not deserve that honor. Only hands that understood the meaning of this place, to him and to his wife, could be allowed. He only permitted one attendant to provide water for the garden, on a schedule, and that was the extent of it. Orson did everything else. Each day, uninterrupted, he toiled and attended the needs of each plant. From bonsai, to the flowers, to a unique fungus collection that always gave him fits because of the smell, he persisted and cared for it all. No interruptions, just his own hands and his memory. 


"For someone who pays this good, I wouldn't imagine you would be doing this yourself!" came a voice, somewhat muffled from the entryway. Orson inhaled, leaned his head back against the gigantic bonsai, before pushing off from the ground, steadying himself as he stood. He stepped down from the soil bed, removing his gloves as he looked at the intrusive presence. Gadshen Pollet stood in the entryway, not daring to come any further into the garden, helm under one arm, standing slack and relaxed. The man wasn't patient, even with his employers, well employer, no matter the amount he was paid. Orson could respect it...to a degree. 


"Do you know what I find curious, Gad?" Orson said as he began to walk towards the man, rubbing his hands together as he looked around the garden, avoiding the gaze of his hired hand. 

"Can't say I do." replied Gadshen.

"Many things. I can't get a certain fern here to stop overcrowding and consuming the nutrients of others like it, no matter how far I replant it. It just keeps growing, as the others wilt. It's roots, they just keep driving deeper and deeper, so much so I have to trim them. It leeches too much." Orson stopped and looked directly into Gadshen's eyes, the mercenary a little taller than Orson. "I also find it curious why you are here, before me, when you were told to never set foot into my place of business." Orson breathed in deeply, a slow exhale rolling out of him. 

Gadshen lowered his eyes with a bob of his head in acknowledgement. "I do understand, and apologize. It wasn't something I wished to do, but I have two things that I needed to bring to you personally. I didn't trust it being sent by any way other than from my own presence. I hope it'll compensate on the intrusion." 


"My office. Now."


Orson led the way to his office, hearing the shift of plate as Gadshen followed behind. Gadshen Pollet had been sought out after investigation by his son, for the need of another pair of eyes in his search for the kyber he sought. The man had a reputable background for doing what was necessary, save for some morality, as Orson wasn't a man without them himself. Gad and his crew, the Black Nova, as cliche as could be, had proven useful. And now he hoped that usefulness was still intact. 


Orson made his way to his seat as they arrived within his office chambers, gesturing to the seat opposite his desk. Gadshen set himself down, the man's dusty features and sprinkling of light grey touched his hair. He had been in his own business for a while, and had earned his reputation, regardless of how many crews he went through. 

"So, what did you hope to relay to me personally?" Orson asked, tapping his finger against the desk. 

Gad shifted in his seat, sitting forward with his hand stretched out, showing two fingers. "Well, two things: we found what you asked for, and in ample supply." As he said this, he pulled a holopad from his satchel and presented it to Orson. Accepting the holopad, Orson began to look at the images and data.

Gad continued, " It's in the debris field, nestled in several asteroids. Its strange. We surveyed multiple rocks, and came up short, but this cluster right here, all had it. It's almost as if they cling together, they don't stray too far apart. We watched them for a while as they drifted, and they stayed right close together."

Orson nodded his head, listening and intrigued by the uniqueness of that property. "Excellent." Orson blew out a breath. "I'm guessing mining and gathering has already began?" 

Gad's eyes fell, as he rubbed his hands together. "Yeah that...that's what brings me to the other thing. We can't exactly do that right now."

Orson set down the holopad as he looked over his desk to Gadshen. "Unexpected problems?" 

"Yeah. The Jedi kind." 


Orson sucked at the back of his teeth, and leaned back in his seat. "Tell me."


"I don't even know how they got wind of us there, or why they even showed up. But it came out bad." said Gadshen, leaning back into his own seat. 

"How bad?" asked Orson, as he held his breath and stared into the man. 

"Well….several got hurt, and the uh, what do they call them...Padawan? Yeah, they ended up dead. Took a third of our crew out, but we left. Before we jumped… Alliance cruisers were jumping in, trying to ping us."


Orson threw his chair out from under him, hands braced on his desk as he now spoke under a tense breath. "Did they track you?" 

"Of course not! We were already star sliding when we saw them coming in. But the supply is gone." said Gad, his face showing a look of defeat. "I don't mess up okay, but there should have been no reason for them to turn up!" 

"Is your crew solid, Gad?" Orson asked. " Are they good on their loyalties?" 

Gad's face took on a range of emotions in the matter of seconds. From incredulous, to anger, to uncertainty, and then back to firm determination. 

"They are solid." Gad replied, staring back at Orson. 


Orson lowered his head and sighed. He didn't know what instance of this debacle was worse, the kyber being commandeered or the possibility that Gad could have been tracked, traced, identified. Orson longed for the peace he had a short while ago. But now was not the time for being idle. 

"Do you have a lead on a secondary location? This primary is already done, so I hope you have another location."

Gad nodded his head, his hand tapping nervously against his helm that rested on his knee. "I do. It might prove to be more risky than the first location though. It's at a memorial site." 

"A what?" Orson said pointedly. 


"Memorial site. From way back when. It's promising, but it'll be some serious vandalism if caught. "

Orson waved his fingers outward as he took his seat again. "You don't have much luxury on options at this point. You are being paid much more than others that could have handled this debacle better. You were hired for discretion, and if needed, your tact. Did my son misplace your skill set, or did you forget it when the Alliance and Jedi showed up unannounced?" 


Gad raised his hands. "All I'm saying is that this one is under watch already, and will be difficult. Doable, but difficult. I don't do repeats. You'll have your source, that I guarantee." 

Orson nodded, leaning back into his seat. "Good, I like promises with no collateral behind them. It makes it easier to collect on the guarantee. Our business is done here for now. Next time however," Orson paused, and looked directly at Gadshen, "If you need to meet directly, find another spot, and either my children, or I will be there, depending on the severity of the matter. Is this understood?" 

Gad nodded. "Very much so, not much life and color in this place. Makes for a more sour atmosphere." Gad stood and with helm in hand, placed it over his head, the *hiss* of the helmet sealing in place as air cycled into it. "And that fern you were going on about? It's parasitic. It feeds off of other plant life nearby until it kills all of them, before it dies itself. Saw them all the time growing up. Best to either root it out, or feed it with lesser plants you don't care about. "


 Gad nodded goodbye before turning and walking from Orson's office chambers, leaving Orson to his own thoughts, and how to fix a problem that just became his own in a fashion. Of all the things to show up, why did it have to be Jedi? It was the last thing he wanted to have to deal with hounding his progress. He knew eventually they would have to be encountered, but he wasn't expecting it to happen in this fashion. He had a mutual respect for what they did to, in some of their policing on the riff raff of criminals that chose to rise and give terror across the galaxy, but their traditional views on and mostly singular coalition with the Alliance didn't help him, or the Sovereignty in the least bit. 


Orson looked down at the holopad Gadshen left behind. Picking it up, he began to browse through the data on the second site the Black Novas would be investigating. Orson swore. This was bold, and honestly, he wasn't sure if anything would prove fruitful from this, but gambles were meant to be made.

BodyText: *[Monolith Station](https://imgur.com/A8FVwNk), Corellia.*

*14:00 Standard Corellian Time.*


Little more than a week had passed since the most eventful night in Crixus's life had transpired. A week since the attempt on his life at the Gold Room by Sigliano Cartel associates. A week since the cryptic words of Sierra Langley. A week since the seemingly destined convergence of Crixus Payne, Julia Verence and Jhoro Daraay. 

One week since Crixus had been proclaimed a God. 

Since then, the trio of Force-sensitive Beings had remained aboard *Monolith,* hidden away in the halls of the Payne family's ancestral home atop the space station, far from the prying eyes of the Corellian Security Forces, who were on high alert following the Gold Room incident. Julia, her identity known only to Crixus, was under threat of being identified as the Jedi present at the high rise club on that night, and it was also Crixus who was presumably searching for her on CorSec's behalf. With his Uncle Dumenaris Payne temporarily away as well, this made *Monolith* an ideal place to lay low while also using the downtime to come to terms with the revelations brought to Crixus's attention by the Sons of Corell, some of whom revealed that they venerated Crixus as a messianic figure that would, in time, claim the mantle of Sith Lord and lead his followers into a new era of dominance over the galaxy. 

Crixus sighed heavily as he flipped over the flimsiplast page of the tome in front of him before raising his eyes to look at the two hooded Beings in the study with him - Sierra Langley and the stalwart Woad. Julia and Jhoro were elsewhere in the Payne estate, likely indulging in one the various accommodations offered by the wealthy family's holdings. 

"Your prophecy, it," Crixus raised an eyebrow, speaking in the direction of Sierra Langley as he quoted, "*'When pretenders rise to power?'* It just seems rather generic."

"Your wisdom grows by the hour, my Lord God," Sierra Langley said, her faith swelling in response to Crixus's observation, rather than addressing it. 

"You're not wrong," chimed the voice of the other, a male Duros who Crixus had come to know as Woad. "The Acolytes of the Beyond that you've been reading of in these texts - our predecessors - used broad strokes, it would seem, in their attempt to reach into the future."

Crixus nodded silently, much more satisfied with Woad's more grounded response than with Sierra Langley's mad devotion and praise. 

"Still, you must forgive them," Woad went on, his crimson, almond-shaped eyes glistening in the soft artificial light, "You must forgive *us.* Though the scales are lifted from our eyes and we know the Dark Side, we are cursed to never feel its embrace."

"My uncle spoke to me often of the Dark Side, especially when it came to its antithetical nature to the philosophies of the Jedi Order," Crixus spoke aloud as he closed the book he had been reading, "But the Sith Order? He rarely spoke of them." Crixus stood up from his seat, feeling the sudden need to stretch. "If I am to become Sith, there is much more that I need to learn, more than these accounts of Corellia's past can teach me."

"Your uncle has been hiding things from you, my Lord," Sierra interjected, her voice souring with malice, "He has placed blinders over your eyes and ears for *years,* he knows *much more* of the Sith than he has let on!" 

Woad nodded along in agreement with Sierra's claims, as if to assure Crixus that there was indeed heavy weight behind the old woman's accusations. 

"It was *we* who showed the Jedi the artifacts from the Great War, *we* who guided *him* to the source of truth and power that he keeps hidden from you!" Sierra's words spat from her mouth with hot hatred, and her pale fists clenched the arms of the chair she sat in. 

"But why?" Crixus pondered, placing a hand to his jawline in contemplation as he listened to Sierra rant, "My uncle is no longer allied with the ways of the Jedi, why hide these things from me? Is he-" 

"Afraid?" Woad offered, "Some of us believe so. Your uncle is no fool, he knows of our prophecy."

"He hates you," Sierra continued, "He has *always* hated you, since you were just an infant. You were supposed to die, Crixus."

Crixus turned away from them both, gazing out of a nearby viewport as he listened to Sierra's words. He knew the words were true, but it still hurt, even after all these years. The hurt burned, an old hurt that he thought he had forgotten. 

"What do you mean?" Crixus asked slowly, turning back towards Sierra, "I was 'supposed to die?' You mean, when the rest of my family…?" 

Both Sierra and Woad bowed their heads in response. 

"Tell me the *truth*!" Crixus spoke through his teeth, his anger beginning to rise, "My uncle told me that it was the Jedi who caused the accident!"

"The Jedi, yes," Sierra's voice was somber as she looked up at Crixus, "*The* Jedi. Search your heart, my Lord. Your uncle is as cruel as he is cunning."

Silence hung in the filtered air of the study, silence that threatened to erupt into a rageful, vengeful explosion of outrage. Crixus's body was tensed, his muscles and tendons tightening in fury and embarrassment as he realized how obviously his uncle had fooled him over the course of his entire life. 

"I…" Crixus's chest rose and fell heavily as he tried to maintain his self control. Woad and Sierra looked at each other, recognizing the Dark Side moving around them through Crixus, even if they could not sense it themselves. 

"You *will* have your revenge, my Lord God!" Sierra assured him, her fervor forcing her from her seat and onto the ground before Crixus, "You will *murder* him as he murdered your mother, your father, your uncles, aunts and cousins!" 

*"I WILL!"* Crixus roared as his fury overtook him, and in that moment a pulsing wave of the Dark Side erupted from his being, sending a telekinetic blast through the room that sent books, flimsiplast, and datapads sprawling around the room. An opened bottle of wine was flung from a nearby table, accompanied by the clanging of metal goblets that all spilled their contents in the sudden storm of power. Woad instinctively held up an arm in front of him as he was knocked backwards while Sierra wailed and cried out in praise of her God's display of raw power. Her cries carried on as the room settled, now looking as if it had survived a surprise tempest. 

Crixus looked around, taking in the disarray he had caused. He had seen his uncle perform such acts, and while Crixus had already all but mastered the Jedi art of telekinesis, this raging storm of the Force was new for him. It felt good. Gone was the sadness and anger he had felt at the truth of his family's demise, replaced with a new confidence in his own abilities. After a moment, he stepped over the debris in the room until he stood over Woad. 

"Show me the way," Crixus reached out with the Force, raising the Duros from the floor without laying a hand on him, "Take me to the source of truth and power that the old crone here spoke of." 

Woad's wide, alien eyes went wider still as his body floated up above the ground. He looked towards Sierra, unsure of how to answer Crixus, but Sierra remained planted on the floor, still smitten with her reverence. 

"I-I do not know where your uncle keeps the artifacts," Woad said, "I don't think Mother Langley even knows-" 

The ancient Sith lightsaber was suddenly in Crixus's hand, and suddenly ignited. 

"Is this not an artifact?" Crixus demanded, pointing one end of the purple lightsaber blades towards the Duros. Terror shown in Woad's eyes, but then he closed them, as if to accept his fate. 

"It is but one of them, my Lord God," Sierra's elderly voice creaked as she spoke up, her face still against the floor panels, "That one was hidden away from your uncle. Hidden *for you.* As I told you before, we *always knew.* Always knew that you would, one day, break free of the spell he has held over you."

"Lord Crixus," Woad said as he reopened his eyes, "I swear it is true that we do not know where your uncle keeps the other artifacts, but there is at least one who does."

"Who?" Crixus demanded. 

"The High Priest of the Church of Corell," Woad answered, "Silas Halcyon. He answers directly to your uncle. If anyone knows, it must be him."

Crixus collapsed the blades of the lightsaber as he released his telekinetic hold over Woad, letting the Duros fall back to his feet. 

"I've met him," Crixus thought back to the name, his lips curling into a knowing smirk, "Married to Director Yu. I'm still coming to terms with the fact that the Church of Corell is more than just a religious organization for the weak minded. Tell me - if I am the centerpoint of the church's prophecy, why did the High Priest not come to greet me, as you did?"

"Your uncle," Woad smoothed the tabard he wore as he spoke, "As I just said, Silas answers to him. We all do, officially. And while there are many that believe you are the fulfillment of the prophecy, there are still many more who are doubtful, and fearful of your uncle's wrath."

"Then we must sway them," Crixus concluded, "Prove to them my Godhood."

"Yes!" Woad agreed, "That is exactly what I was going to suggest before you, uh," the Duros looked away and then back again as he restructured his thoughts, "You must perform the ritual of the Prime Meridian. Through blood, and through fire, the ritual will prove to the others that you are in fact the Sith Lord that we have been waiting for!"

"Prime Meridian?" Crixus repeated the phrase. 

"Yes my Lord God," Sierra chimed in, now standing again, "At the Meridian Grove. You know of this place?" 

Crixus thought about it for a moment, searching his memories before nodding. 

"Yes, that's right - the Meridian Grove. The… CorSec vacation community?" The words sounded a bit strange as he said them, "I know of the place, but I've never been there, myself."

"Yes, but it's so much more than that!" Sierra nodded, assuring Crixus that he had surmised correctly. 

"We will need time to prepare," Woad added before Crixus could demand that the ritual be performed, "The Prime Meridian can only be achieved when 'the Sun is hidden from sight.'"

"'When rays of starlight cast cold shadows upon us,'" Sierra continued the next verse of the prophecy, almost out of habit. 

"As the Force would have it, the next ritual is set to take place after the turn of the next galactic standard year, when Corell will be eclipsed by other astral bodies in our System." 

"Fascinating," Crixus said genuinely, quietly awed by the seemingly inexorable way that the Force - no, the Dark Side of the Force - had aligned his destiny, much like the predicted alignment of the planets in the local star system. 

"Now that you are aware of the truth, we will begin the work of preparing the rest of the Sons of Corell for your ascension," Sierra Langley bowed her head as she came to stand near Woad. 

"Yes," Crixus agreed, "I need more time, as it is. I have unfinished business that I must attend to, and there is the matter of Verence and Daraay. They are even less prepared than I was to accept what is to come, but I will need their help if I am to defeat my uncle."

"We will return to the shadows, Lord Crixus," Woad said, "We must make haste, lest your uncle return and find us here aiding you, prematurely. After the Prime Meridian though, not even the High Priest will be able to deny your Godhood."

"Very well. You have both earned my favor this day," Crixus bestowed his words upon Langley and Woad before turning his back to them. "Now, leave me. I have much to think on, and much to prepare before my uncle returns."

Sierra Langely and Woad both bowed, their faces lit with newfound confidence and fervor by their Lord's words of assurance as they turned to make their exit.

Vince Kobver had served his planet for many cycles. Born a chiss to immigrant parents, he had grown up on Serenno. Eventually, when the time came, he had chosen to raise his own family here. Even when that meant becoming a lawman, to protect those he loved from the nastier side of his home world. He had fought the old regime on their leinancy with the gangs and cartels. Even back when he was fresh out of the academy, he had known Del Descoteaux was trouble. The Serenno Cartel tarnished the once admirable Countship of Serenno with it’s machinations and manipulations. On several occasions, he had fought against cartel gangsters in the streets in a futile attempt to preserve justice in a nearly fully corrupted society. When Almorus Serenno-Borgin finally returned and began rebuilding the Ministry of Security from the ground up, Vince had been awarded, even given a medal for his courageous service. He was promoted to a loftier position and given a hefty pay raise for his assistance in transitioning the new Count to power. For a short time, despite the hardships of living a long life in Carannia, everything had been good. 

But as Vince Kobver stood down the Serenno Cartel in that grand white stone courtyard, he knew he was going to die. 

***
It was a cold night outside of the The Regal Belsallian Hotel and Recluse. Five shivering figures, all members of the Serenno State Security Bureau, slowly and nervously traced their blaster rifles from window to window as falling snowflakes nipped at their exposed skin. It was eerily quiet. Even the sounds of the Belsallian Sea could be heard crashing against a shore of ice and sand, some fifty meters away. 

A voice broke the silence, the same that had just shouted a different question several moments earlier. “Are you lot kriffing deaf?”

Katskee Snowfarr gripped the rifle in her hands tighter, but said nothing. The unseen object that hung from her belt begged to be released, but it was too soon. So she kept it tucked away. The officers all looked towards the chiss gentleman, Vince Kobver, for his lead, as he had taken point. 

The unseen individual up on the rooftop sighed loudly, annoyed by the apparent delay. “Look, I’m perfectly fine killing you all, if she isn’t present. I just wanted to give my sincerest gratitude to the individual who had tipped us off about this raid. Marlan Sleaskin sends his regards, and such.” 

The State Security strike team exchanged confused glances. This woman Marlan had mentioned, Cora Sanarra, had alerted the Sleaskin crime family about the details of their raid? Set this trap for them? 

Dafnel, the blue skinned twi’lek woman who had swiped their heavy weaponry from Evidence, took a small step forward and lowered her rifle slightly. “You’re fighting a war that will only end badly!” She shouted upwards, to where she assumed the unseen rooftop voice had been standing. Katskee watched with intrigue as Dafnel took another step forward. And then another. Vince seemed to notice too, and he muttered something to Dafnel that Katskee couldn’t quite hear. Whatever he said didn’t stop the female officer from taking yet another step. 

“Ah, kriff off.” The voice, who seemingly identified themself as Marlan Sleaskin, was barely audible as he moved about on the rooftop. 

Dafnel was now a handful of paces ahead of Katskee and the other officers. The woman had both of her feet planted solidly. Her rifle hung dejected in one hand. “Ah, blast it,” In the blink of an eye, Dafnel, swung one of their prized Smart Rockets off of her shoulder and aimed it upwards towards where she had last heard Marlan’s voice. “Katskee, now!” She shouted.

The hefty cylindrical object hanging beneath her trench coat was dropped to the cobblestone, and Katskee kneeled next to it. She heard as Marlan screamed something from the rooftops, just as a loud roaring noise signified the firing of a Smart Rocket. Katskee gripped the dual release system on the squad shield she held and pulled, activating a bright blue energy core within. As blaster fire began raining down into the courtyard, a radiant blue dome expanded and shielded the four officers within its perimeter. 

But not Dafnel, who had intentionally exited the radius to safely fire her Smart Rocket. The projectile she fired collided with the Regal Belsallian. The structure shook as stone and glass fragments blew outward, raining harmlessly against the shielded dome as Dafnel’s body was torn asunder by the cartel blasters. Her aim had seemed to be true, but blinded as they were, it was impossible to tell whether or not she had successfully caught Marlan in the blast. 

“Karabast,” Vince exclaimed as the remaining officers retreated further into their safety bubble. Four pairs of eyes nervously checked the hovering energy core within the shield device falter as continued blaster fire splattered across the dome. “Everyone check your blasters, we’re going to have to get out there to buy ourselves some time,” His orders were obvious. They couldn’t remain within the shield for too long, or they risked it overloading. In part to Dafnel’s lack of an attempt to stall the cartel, it would still be some time before any reinforcements reached their position. “We’re going to have to fight our way out of this.” 

Vince moved first. Under the cover of blaster residue, he was able to make it behind a nearby stone handrail. The energy core stabilized slightly as a portion of the cartel’s focus was pulled away from the squad shield. Then Katskee moved. She knelt close to the ground and ran in the opposite direction Vince had. Red hot bolts crackled against the cobblestone around her as she slid behind the short wall of a foundation. 

“Marlan, you shukking rat, you’d better still be alive,” Katskee hissed as she reloaded her blaster rifle. 

There were still many cartel members lining the various windows, save for the section decimated by Dafnel’s rocket. Too many to count accurately, but so far, none of them had produced any heavy weaponry. Another Smart Rocket went off across the courtyard, and the Regal Belsallian Hotel and Recluse was rocked by another explosion. Katskee took the distraction as an opportunity, lining her large MK rifle up, and taking a shot at one of the occupied alcoves. Her bolt collided with her target. 

One down.

The Serenno Security team had been outnumbered, but as the fighting broke out, their training and weaponry proved to be an unexpected edge. When the third Smart Rocket went off moments later, the resulting explosion caused an entire section of the old stone building to collapse onto itself. White chalky dust and smoke exploded up and out, before drifting down into the plaza as the rubble subsided. The bolts of concentrated red plasma criss crossing the courtyard refused to cease. 

Each time she reloaded her rifle cartridge, it meant another Sleaskin goon was dead. Katskee was vaguely aware when the squad shield to her right was suddenly overloaded, the security officer who had been pinned down within effortlessly silenced. Based on the regular fire still going off across the courtyard, she could figure that at least one of her companions still remained fighting. She had to act soon, before their reinforcements arrived. 

Wordlessly, Katskee adopted the shadows as her own as she stealthed forward through the hazy courtyard. She had shrugged off her trench coat and dropped the MK sniper rifle back behind the fountain, favoring now a small, single handed X-8 styled blaster pistol. Serenno State Security standard issue. She vanished behind a handrail. Under a broken tree. Around a collapsed balcony. Whoever remained of the scattered Sleaskin crime family, they were focused elsewhere as Katskee silently moved to the edge of the building. It was then that she procured another device from her belt that had previously remained unseen beneath the trench coat, a handheld grappling device. After quickly being primed, Katskee fired it upward. The tip of the line cemented itself into the edge of the rooftop and the grappling device reeled itself upward, allowing Katskee to walk up the side of the pockmarked wall. 

A cartel member, presumably after hearing the sound of a metallic wire whizzing outside his window, ventured a look out. His quizzical glance was quickly met with a shot to the head. One story, two stories, three. Soon, Katskee had reached the roof, which she quickly climbed up onto. Barricades had been mostly abandoned by this point. Unsurprising, considering a few meters over, an entire wing of the building had collapsed without warning. 

Still, Katskee wasn’t entirely alone. She raised her pistol and dispatched the few active figures still mulling about on the roof. Behind her, out towards the sea, Katskee could see nothing. The grey clouds had once again suffocated the moon, and now drowned the sky in darkness. Towards the city however, spread out lights signified many late night creatures were still hard at work, or mulling about their homes or apartments. Three hovering lights high above the massive superstructures that made up the downtown district signified police gunships were inbound, and she was running out of time. 

Marlan Sleaskin was easily identifiable by an ugly white scar that broke his chin, though Katskee had to smear blood off his face to even uncover it. Thankfully, he was still alive. She pressed a cool bacta bandage into his abdomen, which seemed to be the main source of his bleeding. “Where is Del Descoteaux?”

The man’s eyes fluttered open. “Kriffin… Del? Del did kriffin poot, you hear?”

“Gods blast you, just tell me where he is,” she pressed the bandage hard into his gut. He cried out softly. 

“I ain’t kriffing lying, you bitch,” he winced. The bandage in her hand was quickly soaked through with blood, so she replaced it with a clean one. “Sure, the boss wants Almorus dead. But that was us who almost killed him. The Sleaskins still run Carannia.” 

“You were about to run from Carannia, you shukking coward.” 

“Kriff off.” 

Katskee tore the bandage away, and instead stood and stomped a boot into the man’s mangled torso. Marlan’s eyes widened in sudden and unexpected pain. “There’s two ways this goes. Tell me what I want, and you die nicely,” She hissed, twisting the toe of her boot about in his gut. 

Marlan rolled onto his side. He let out garbled exhale as blood splattered down his chin. “He’s… kriffing… south. Aparian… wastes.” 

Before she could figure out any more specifics, or even grant him the promised quick death, Marlan Sleaskin expired at her feet. Enraged, she stepped out of his chest, and kicked his body off of the rooftop. She was almost out of time, she could now hear the approaching gunships as they sped across the city. 

***
Vince Kobver lay in a pool of blood, though he doubted it was all his own. Small fires burned around him, amidst the broken rubble of the Regal Belsallian Hotel and Recluse. There were still a number of gang members about, though as far as his comrades went, they had all fallen. Save for Katskee Snowfarr, who he had seen disappear up onto the roof. He had done his best to stop the bleeding, but he had been hit numerous times. He could feel the cold setting in as his fingers relaxed away from the wounds, letting go of the pressure he had so methodically maintained. 

When three Sleaskin gangsters found his body and began rifling through his belongings, he didn’t make a sound. He was resigned to his fate. They poked and prodded, but it hurt less than the blasters had. Still, the dying flame in him couldn’t help but ignite again at the sound of a blaster pistol firing off. Three shots? Vince would recognize the sound of an X-8 anywhere, he’d been shooting them for nearly five decades. He managed to open his eyes. He was now face to face with the horrifying visage of a dead woman, one of the Sleaskins, her mangled skull still burning with a bright hole of a recent blaster shot. He felt someone grab his wrists and flip him onto his back, and then drag him across the blood soaked cobblestone until he lay behind cover. 

“There’s still some of them skulking about,” Katskee Snowfarr whispered. She leaned over him now, and was checking his wounds. 

“In my bag… there’s bacta mist.” He coughed. A dabble of blood splattered across the woman’s face, but she didn’t react. For the first time all night, he tasted the familiar metallic flavor of blood in his mouth. Katskee got up and located his pack of belongings, which he had tossed in the firefight. After a moment, she located his first aid kit, and procured a sealed spray container of the regenerative substance. “My chest.” He tried motioning downward, but he had lost most feeling by this point, and only the tips of his fingers vaguely gestured about. 

Katskee broke the seal on the bacta mist, and began spraying it onto herself. A bit through her dust covered hair. She used it to clean some of the grime off her face and hands. He could only watch on in horror as she half emptied the container, before dropping it onto the cobblestone between them. The top popped off as it bounced between the bricks, and the blueish substance began mingling with the blood and dirt. She then crawled back towards him, a facade of innocence spelled out across her face. “I don’t think there’s any left,” her eyes were wide, taunting him. 

“Who.. why…” 

“Come on, Vince,” she encouraged him. “Surely you figured it out by now. I’m Cora Sanarra.”

A cold shiver ran down his spine. He recognized that name. “You… turned us… in. Played us.” 

“You’re quick,” she teased, playfully poking at his wounded chest. “I needed us all here tonight. It was the only way to make sure Marlan would stay.”

He tried to speak again. Maybe to curse her out, or to threaten the weight or Serenno law down onto her shoulders. But the words never came. His cold, dying form rolled over until he lay face down in the mixture of debris and fluids. 

The sounds of the gunships were nearly overhead now. Cora pulled a thermal detonator from her belt and placed it in Vince’s stiff hand, activating it as she did. “For your body cam,” she explained, clasping his shoulder before jogging away. 

Vince was barely conscious as he heard the detonator countdown. He realized, just before it went off, that his premonition had been correct. He was never going to leave this courtyard alive.

***

Graf Barbott saw the explosion as the gunships arrived. “Down there, there’s still fighting going on!” He yelled to the pilot. The State Security gunships arrived with their guns blazing. Their heavy rotating cannons tore through what remained of the already damaged hotel, sending the bodies of gangsters flying from the windows and rooftops. After circling the plaza, one of them finally landed and picked Katskee Snowfarr up. She was gingerly holding her side, and covered in filth. The rest of the officers had all been killed in action. Graf Barbott, her inspector trainee assistant, helped her weakly climb aboard and buckle in. 

They’d bring her to a medical center, to make sure she didn’t suffer any major injuries. Once reinforcements arrived at the remains of the Regal Belsallian, the Serenno State Security detail was able to confirm the body of Marlan Sleaskin, as well as a vast host of his associates. Katskee would be visited by higher ups at work in the following days, congratulated for completing her duty amid the toughest of circumstances. The holonews, which dubbed the incident the “Belsallian Massacre'', claimed the unnamed female detective who survived the event a “tribute to her world.” 

A few days went by, and she remained quiet. Only when the dust truly began to settle did Cora Sanarra uncover the encrypted transmitter given to her by Marclay and send out a single message.

BodyText: Her legs crossed one over the other, Ravee sat stock-still in the cold, her hands folded almost lazily over each other in her lap. Behind her was the Ossus temple - and beneath her, the snow and frozen stone that bit at her skin. She could see some of the sandstone beneath, up the spines of the four spires at the front of the massive temple... But around her, in the snow, there was nothing put pale, white nothingness. 


Despite the discomfort, the blankness was oddly comforting, removing visual distractions as she brought her thoughts into focus. The discomfort of the cold stone, however, was nothing but a distraction - but what advancement was there in meditation if there was nothing to shut out, nothing to pull your mind away from? 


Closing her eyes, Ravee gently inhaled through her nose, exhaling slowly through her mouth. In, out, in, out... 


She had much to think about, after all, and meditation helped her calm her emotions, to push out all the nagging thoughts in her head so she could focus completely on whatever task was at hand. 


Then, of course, there were the words of her fellow Jedi, Master Aruwa and Volene in particular. Both seemed to think she'd been punishing herself too harshly for what was a mistake she deeply regretted, one which she knew was terrible, and she found herself inclined to agree... 


And yet, that wasn't all that was occupying Ravee's thoughts. 


Clenching and releasing her hands, she felt cold water on her hand, so faint that it felt as if she were experiencing the sensation through the body of another, distant and ethereal. Insignificant.


Sometimes, in moments like these, Ravee felt insignificant too, like she was little more than a pawn stumbling through life, unable to do much of import - like a snowflake. Like a snowflake, she’d one day fade, too, and she couldn’t help but wonder if she’d be remembered for long. She’d thrown herself wholly into the battle against Udon Zan... And yet, she’d accomplished so little. Jedi had died in the process - was it because of her inability to save them, she wondered?


That, of course, was what worried her most about it all. Ravee didn’t want to be remembered, not specifically. She didn’t want fame, and didn’t believe she'd ever truly enjoy it... But she wanted to help people, too. She wanted to make the loves of other people better, not for fame, but because it felt right...


She’d done it before, of course, but after the battle and especially her conversations with master Aruwa and Volene, she couldn’t help but wonder - could she do more?


If she'd been calmer after the accident, could she have done more to suppress Udon Zan’s powers, or even helped to subdue him entirely?


Despite all that Master Aruwa said, she couldn’t help but come back to that feeling that she *personally* wasn’t doing enough. Even if they was little chance she’d succeed at managing to without without arms, and instead with the Force for daily tasks, she *wanted* to try, and she could. Even if she failed...


Even if she failed, perhaps the experience would still be enlightening, she thought. Even then, it would still bring her closer to the force, allowing her to achieve greater calm... And more yet, perhaps. It was unusual, unexpected, and unorthodox...


Yet Ravee couldn’t help but crack a small smile at the thought of challenging herself in dutiful service to the Order. As long as they didn’t deny her permission, then...


“I’ll do it.” She whispered, nodding slowly. “I’ll do it. If it doesn’t work out, I can still get prosthetics... But I have to try now, while I have the chance.”


The vows she’d initially planned to punish herself with, however, were another matter.


With the cloud of manslaughter lifted from her mind, even if guilt still lingered, she couldn’t shake the thought of them from her mind. Master Aruwa had practically told her that they were unnecessary, that she didn’t need to tear herself apart over a mistake she both understood as a mistake and deeply regretted, but that didn’t change the fact that she yet still felt *excited* about them.


After all, if she were correct, they’d help bring her closer to the force, and bring her even further along her journey as a Jedi, and that excited her more than anything else.


*All I have to do, I suppose, is tell them.*


Opening her eyes, Ravee took in another heavy breath as sensation rushed back into her body, her eyes cast upward to the dark bulb at the very top of the spire closest to her.


*Trust in the force*. It was just as her master had told her - once again, the Force had led her to exactly the answers she’d needed.
